# lattice-tumor-ctdna
## This repo includes the code used to generate the results in our paper:
dependencies: `python3 v11, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn` 
## Tumor simulation code:
`classes.py`: class definitions for the lattice simulation\
`main.py`: wrapper functions to configure parameters and call the simulator\
`utils.py`: various helper functions and plotters\
`demo.ipynb`: notebook showing an example run of the simulator and the resulting trajectory of ctDNA and tissue clone fractions and overall population
## Code to reproduce figures:
`make_figs.py`: code to produce subfigures used in all results and supplementary material\
`code-for-figures.ipynb`: notebook that loads raw data and runs the methods in make_figs.py to produce all subfigures. 
## Data:
raw data
